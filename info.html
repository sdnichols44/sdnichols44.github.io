				<h3>Frontend Edits</h3>
				<p>Frontend edits are, as the title suggests, edits that are made in Frontend.txt, which needs to be extracted from the assets manually, using the <a class='link' href='https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE'>Unity Asset Bundle Extractor</a>. The main use for this file is to add localisation to the game, which cannot be done inside many of the moddable text files you may be modding. Adding localisation is entirely optional, and it has no impact on game stability or the ability of the game to use your modded data. However, it means that every player who uses your mod in a language different to the one you made your content in will either be unable to read it (because they don't know that language), or will have random bits of, say, English text in their otherwise Italian version.</p>

				<p>The edits were only really required before the GT DLC was released, where PlaySport added new 'Custom' fields to the files which were Workshop compatible. That's where another important point comes in - if you are planning on releasing your mod on the Workshop, then Frontend isn't even compatible anyway! Therefore, unless you are working on an overhaul or large mod like 'Rebirth', then you should not waste time with Frontend at all.</p>

				<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
				<p>There is a lot of different variables and values for the various special requirements some traits can have, which I have collated in the various tables below. If you are still unsure of what something does, then consult the relevant text file to see where it is used, or ask one of the many people on the Rebirth Discord.</p>

			<div id='ptraits-requirements' class='ptraits-spacer hide'>
			<h4 class='ui dividing header'>Requirements</h4>
				<p>Requirements allow you to define more specific circumstances for your traits to be rolled, such as whether the driver is from a range of countries, or if they have won a championship, or if they've had a bad result, or even all three at once. Further, a single requirement can even have a range of options. The table below lays out all current known requirements and all known effects of these requirements.</p>
				<p>If you find that some information is incorrect, then please message Brian on the Rebirth Discord and let me know what corrections need to be made.</p>

				<h4 class='ui dividing header'>Special Cases, Text and Descriptions</h4>
				<p>Special Cases set further requirements and effects on your trait. Some will make the trait only take effect when under circumstances such as the driver being in the lead of the race, or is racing closely with another car. Others set conditions where a driver will not join another team if their rival is already driving there, or applies the trait effects if they aren't the number 1 driver at their own team. It helps create additional versatility for traits, and variety where drivers can appear to actually have their own personality.</p>

				<h3>Part Components</h3>
				<p>Part Components are a very easy area to work on, as a lot of it is straight-forward. However, there is one area with absolutely no documentation or help - component icons. This has been a tough section to put together because despite all my time spent on this area of the game, even I have very little documentation on what 'Icon Path' and 'Icon' refers to.</p>
				<button class='blue ui button components'>Show Icons</button>
			</div>
			<div id='pcomponents-icons' class='pcomponents-spacer hide'>
				<h4 class='ui dividing header'>Icons</h4>
				<p>Each component you create needs to have an icon that gives an idea of what effect it'll have at a glance, and adds some nice visuals to the part building screens. If you don't specify an icon at all (i.e. leave the box blank), you'll just end up with a white square where the icon should be. Therefore, icons are absolutely required if you don't want to have the UI looking odd when in game.</p>

				<p>There are two types of icon, one for regular components, and one for parts the Lead Designer has, with their own shapes and use cases. Below are two tables, with regular components in one, and Designer (engineer) in the other. A preview has been provided for all icons so you know what you'll see once in-game.</p>
